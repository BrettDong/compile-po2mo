A blazing fast CLI program to compile GNU gettext .po file to binary .mo format.

## Usage

You can either specify a concrete pair of input and output file paths:

`$ compile-po2mo input.po output.mo`

Or you can also give a pair of path patterns denoted by `<lang>`:

`$ compile-po2mo "./i18n/translations/<lang>.po" "./build/i18n/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/app.mo"`

In the latter case, all `.po` files matching the pattern will be compiled to the destination path:

```
./i18n/translations/ja.po => ./build/i18n/ja/LC_MESSAGES/app.mo
./i18n/translations/es_ES.po => ./build/i18n/es_ES/LC_MESSAGES/app.mo
...
```

On Windows, the path pattern has to be in backslash separator and do not contain current directory: `.\compile-po2mo.exe i18n\translations\<lang>.po build\i18n\<lang>\LC_MESSAGES\app.mo`. On UNIX shell, the path pattern has to be quoted.

## Limitation / Caveat

Just compiles a single `.po` file in UTF-8 encoding to a `.mo` file in UTF-8 encoding and nothing else. No fancy features, no rigorous input sanity check, all for maximum performance. The program may panic or silently produce nonsense output when input data is ill-formed. You should only run this when all input data is trusted, and you want to cut down project build times and CI/CD costs.
